##About 
Hash Code is a team-based programming competition organized by Google. You pick your team and programming language, we pick a real-life engineering problem to solve. Are you up for the challenge?


##Past problem statements
### [Route Loon Balloons](https://hashcode.withgoogle.com/2015/tasks/hashcode2015_final_task.pdf)
#####Hash Code 2015, Final Round 
Project Loon aims to bring universal Internet access using a fleet of high altitude balloons equipped with LTE transmitters. Circulating around the world, Loon balloons deliver Internet access in areas that lack conventional means of Internet connectivity. Given the wind data at different altitudes, plan altitude adjustments for a fleet of balloons to provide Internet coverage to select locations.

### [Optimize a Data Center](https://hashcode.withgoogle.com/2015/tasks/hashcode2015_qualification_task.pdf)
#####Hash Code 2015, Online Qualification Round 
For over ten years, Google has been building data centers of its own design, deploying thousands of machines in locations around the globe. In each of these of locations, batteries of servers are at work around the clock, running services we use every day, from Google Search and YouTube to the Judge System of Hash Code. Given a schema of a data center and a list of available servers, your task is to optimize the layout of the data center to maximize its availability.

### [Street View Routing](https://hashcode.withgoogle.com/2014/tasks/hashcode2014_final_task.pdf)
#####Hash Code 2014, Final Round 
The Street View imagery available in Google Maps is captured using specialized vehicles called Street View cars. These cars carry multiple cameras capturing pictures as the car moves around a city. Capturing the imagery of a city poses an optimization problem: the fleet of cars is available for a limited amount of time and we want to cover as much of the city streets as possible.
